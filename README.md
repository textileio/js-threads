## Using Threads

To get started using Threads, check out the [docs site](https://docs.textile.io/) and [API documentation](https://textileio.github.io/js-threads).

## Getting help

The Textile/Threads developers/community are active on [Slack](https://slack.textile.io/) and [Twitter (@textileio)](https://twitter.com/textileio), join us there for news, discussions, questions, and status updates. Also, [check out our blog](https://blog.textile.io) for the latest posts and announcements.

If you think you've found a bug in Threads, please file a Github issue. Take a look at our comprehensive [contributor guide](#contributing) for details on how to get started.

## Background

Textile's Threads Protocol and Database provides an alternative architecture for data on the web. Threads aims to help power a new generation of web technologies by combining a novel use of event sourcing, Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD), and access control to provide a distributed, scalable, and flexible database solution for decentralized applications. Threads is backed by a great deal of research and experience, and provides protocols for securely storing and sharing content-addressable data (on IPFS), with tooling to help standardize data creation and dissemination.

The primary public API to Threads is the [Threads Database](./packages/database). The Database aims to provide:

- [x] Document & [datastore compliant](https://github.com/ipfs/js-datastore-level) key-value store
- [x] Familiar APIs (think [mongodb/mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com)!)
- [x] [Offline](http://offlinefirst.org) and/or [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html) storage and remote/peer sync
- [x] User/developer authentication & cloud support
- [ ] Multiple transport options (pubsub, direct p2p, IPNS, etc)
- [ ] Cryptographically-driven access control
- [x] Encryption and IPLD encoding
- [x] Configurable codecs (i.e., handling conflicts via [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) etc)
- [ ] Fast indexes and queries
- [x] Multiple API entry points and levels (low- and high-level APIs)
- [ ] Direct integration with common frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Electron, etc)

Plus more features on the way!

### Overview



## Install

`js-threads` is implemented as a series of sub-packages. For general use, you can get most of what you need by simply installing and using the `@textile/threads` library.

```shell script
npm install --save @textile/threads
```

If you are running `js-threads` in an environment that does not support [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) by default (such as Node), be sure to include it explicitly using something like the following at the top of your script or module:

```javascript
// Add WebSocket to the global namespace on Node
global.WebSocket = require('isomorphic-ws')
```

## Usage

For an introduction to use the `Database` classe, read the [Threads Introduction here](https://docs.textile.io/threads/). Additionally, there are a growing list of [examples](https://github.com/textileio/js-examples) available.

## Authentication

Textile provides remote Threads APIs you can use when developing your app. See [`@textile/hub`](https://textileio.github.io/js-hub) (or [docs.textile.io](https://docs.textile.io)) for details on authenticating with these APIs, and how to set up your own local development peer.

## Developing

Underlying the Threads Database are a number of ideas and technologies, which are outlined in detail in the [Threads whitepaper](https://github.com/textileio/papers). These components are all housed within this [mono-repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), and include a set of [core modules](./packages/core) for creating Thread identities and keys (`@textile/threads-core`), as well as tooling for data [encryption and encoding](./packages/encoding) (`@textile/threads-encoding`), networking (with support for [local](./packages/network) (`@textile/threads-network`) and [remote](./packages/network-client) (`@textile/threads-network-client`) key management), and a local-first, event-sourced [storage layer](./packages/store) (`@textile/threads-store`). There are also two entry points for running Threads DB, including a [local-first Javascript _module_](./packages/database) (`@textile/threads-database`), and a [remote-only, Javascript _client_](./packages/client) (`@textile/threads-client`).

This mono-repo is all managed by [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). You shouldn't have to do anything special to get started, however, here are a few steps that will make it easier to develop new functionality locally.

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:textileio/js-threads.git
cd js-threads
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

Then you are pretty much ready to go. You can run tests for all sub-packages from the root directory:

```bash
npm test
# Or run the node- or browser-specific tests separately
npm run test:node
npm run test:browser
```

Similarly, you can compile the Typescript-based sub-packages to Javascript all at once. This will also build the browser bundles via webpack:

```bash
npm run build
```

This project also uses incremental Typescript builds, so to take advantage of that (rather than building from scratch each time) use `compile`. You should notice significant speed-ups in your build process:

```shell script
npm run compile
```

## Releasing

This project utilises lerna's 'independent' release mode. So each time you run `lerna publish`, it will check for local updates and determine which packages have changed and need publishing. To do this locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are on a clean master branch (we only want to release from master). If you have to, run `lerna clean && lerna bootstrap` to get to a clean state. If this produces new changes, then make sure you commit these (or reject them) before proceeding.
2. Ensure that webpack and webpack-cli are available. Ideally, install these globally. It is also a good idea to have typescript available globally. `npm i -g webpack webpack-cli typescript`
3. Ensure your git config does not specify signed tags. The `lerna` cli tool does not seem to be able to handle these at this time.
4. Ensure you are logged in to an npmjs.org account that has permission to publish to the @textile org/scope.
5. Run `lerna publish`, and sit back and wait. Ideally, this will go off without a hitch.

If it fails after creating tags and/or pushing the version updates to git, but before the actual npm publish completes, you should be able to 'recover' by running `lerna publish from-package`, which will attempt to publish new releases based on the versions available on npmjs.org. If it failed before or during tag creation, you might have to start over by dropping the version updates (`git checkout -- .`) and trying again. If `lerna` managed to _commit_ the changes, you can use something like `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to reset the last commit, followed by `git push --force --follow-tags` (if it was pushed to remote already and you are allowed to do pushes to master), **but check that the right commit was reverted first**.

See the [lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#what-can-lerna-do) for other things you can do to make working across multiple packages easier. **Note**: If you are using `lerna` commands directly (as opposed to the ones wrapped in the package.json scripts), you'll want to install `lerna` globally to make your life easier: `npm i -g lerna`.
