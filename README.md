There are also several useful examples included as tests in the [sub-packages](https://github.com/textileio/js-threads/tree/master/packages) of this repo.

## Developing

This mono-repo is made up of several sub-packages, all managed by [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). You shouldn't have to do anything special to get started, however, here are a few steps that will make it easier to develop new functionality locally.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:textileio/js-threads.git
cd js-threads
npm i
lerna bootstrap
```

Then you are pretty much ready to go. You can run tests for all sub-packages from the root directory:

```bash
npm test
# Or run the node- or browser-specific tests separately
npm run test:node
npm run test:browser
```

Similarly, you can compile the Typescript-based sub-packages to Javascript all at once:

```bash
lerna run build
```

See the [lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#what-can-lerna-do) for other things you can do to make working across multiple packages easier.
